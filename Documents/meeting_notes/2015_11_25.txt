- Focus on improving UI a lot
- Organize/Attend tabs or have them take up more space
- Maybe don’t include your own events in your Attend feed (if you’re logged in)
- Use Google Maps for location
- Input times or check All Day
- add image for Event
- use different UI for time input
- assign someone to a Todo
	- sort Todos by assigned/unassigned/assigned to you
- default Todo templates
- option to see your Todos without having to go into an Event
