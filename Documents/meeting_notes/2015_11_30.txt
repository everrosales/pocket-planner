Meeting notes for TA meeting November 30, 2015


ta looked over her feedback, synchronized with other TAs, and gave us more points (yay!)

event model -> files because industry standard, so no points taken off
  - difference of opinion (many files vs. long file) so don't have to change

modularizing :event code
  misunderstanding - put into model file vs. put into separate method

idiot-proof vs. restrictive
  - attending own event should be possible (argued with ta for this)
    although invite page should have something special to signify that user is planner
  - duplicate todos probably fine

don't need to require account for attendee (but should be optional - for saving information for future events)

object.freeze probably unnecessary (so won't take off points), but should add it anyway




reminder to do default todos?
