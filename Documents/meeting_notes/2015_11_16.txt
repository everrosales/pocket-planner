Meeting notes for TA meeting November 16, 2015



our meeting agenda looks fine - doesn't need to be any more fleshed out than we have

feedback on design doc:
  overview, motivation fine
  concepts:
    attendance - not really a concept? more of a state
    event - good, means a little more than just a calendar event
    calendar, todo good, carry meaning
  ui looks fine
  design challenge looks fine (esp. liked the options, and selecting one)

she'll send more detailed, line-by-line comments tonight
  
most of the functionality is creating, adding, deleting things (etc) - fine for MVP
  going forward, however, think of more features we can add (post-MVP) - such as email
  (which is already included...) but things like that


feedback on data model:
  -keeping track of deleted attendees - give attendees status instead of different types


developing in horizontal layers rather than concepts (probably fine, as long as work isn't imbalanced.)
  -eg. don't have one person doing only css and one person doing the whole server and one person writing tests
  -make sure to have specs or some sort of design so that ppl aren't waiting for other people
  -but fine if people want to focus on different parts (eg. datamodel vs ui vs etc)


additional features would be a good idea (for next meeting, have list of features and 
  choosing to implement or not implement them)
